# hotmeal

HTML toolkit with typed DOM, html5ever parsing, tree diffing, and serialization.

## Features

- **HTML5 Parsing**: Full HTML5 tree construction via html5ever with error recovery
- **Typed DOM**: Type-safe DOM manipulation with facet integration
- **Tree Diffing**: GumTree/Chawathe algorithm via cinereus for efficient DOM patches
- **Serialization**: HTML output with proper escaping and formatting

## Usage

```rust
use hotmeal::{parse_body, diff::{diff, apply_patches}};

// Parse HTML
let old = parse_body("<div><p>Hello</p></div>");
let new = parse_body("<div><p>World</p></div>");

// Compute patches
let patches = hotmeal::diff::diff(&old, &new).expect("diffing should succeed");

// Apply patches to transform old into new
let mut old_diff: hotmeal::diff::Element = (&old).into();
hotmeal::diff::apply_patches(&mut old_diff, &patches).expect("patches should apply");
```
